### Overview

This project oversaw the design and construction of a desktop “smart fan” which uses tracking technology to enable the fan to autonomously follow a nearby person, making it ideal for individual use in dynamic workspaces. The tracking mechanism should increase the efficacy in cooling the person by ensuring that it is optimally positioned to promote convective heat loss from the target, reducing heat fatigue and allowing the user to feel more comfortable.
